                    <p><em>
                        Being born and raised just 45 minutes from Manhattan gave me expansive culture           exposure to the world. My mother was a graphic designer in the early 90's and always     had the latest computer and software. I remember having to use dial up internet to connect and getting disconnected every time someone picked up the phone.</em></p>

                    <p><em>
                        I moved to Tucson about 15 years ago to attend the University of Arizona. I received a BA in Art Education with an emphasis in Printmaking. Since then I have worked in many schools as a volunteer, substitute teacher, and special needs aid. Currently I am employed at the Gaslight Theater working in the costume shop. I have also been a small business owner for the last 10 years selling products on four platforms.</em></p>

                    <p><em>
                        Between being a mother of two, working part time at the costume shop, maintaining and
                        expanding my small business, I am attending the University of Arizona's continuing
                        education. I hope to receive a certificate of completion in their Coding Bootcamp program
                        with a vast knowledge of web development experience.</em></p>
